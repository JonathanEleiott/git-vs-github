# git vs GitHub

- git
  - version control (tracking and managing changes to software code)
  - series of commands to manage our project

- GitHub
  - place to store our projects

- git commands
  - git init -> allows a project to use git commands
  - git status -> shows what has added/changed/deleted since your last commit

- 3 different stages
  - working directory
