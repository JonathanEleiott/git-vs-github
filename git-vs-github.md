# git vs GitHub

- git
  - version control (tracking and managing changes to software code)
  - series of commands to manage our project

- GitHub
  - place to store our projects

- git commands
  - git init -> allows a project to use git commands
  - git status -> shows what has added/changed/deleted since your last commit
  - git add -> moves files/folders to the staging area
  - git commit -> takes everything from the staging area and makes it permanent*
  - git diff -> shows the difference in files since the last commit

- 3 different stages
  - working directory
  - staging area
  - project
